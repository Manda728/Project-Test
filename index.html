            <em>"Equine sports massage is the therapeutic application of massage
                techniques applied to the horse by the manipulation of the soft
                tissues to help achieve increased performance levels and endurance,
                treat or prevent injury and improve recovery rates"</em>

            Equine massage is not only good for the horse's overall well-being but
            may also benefit the horse by:

        <ul>
            <li>Improving muscle tone</li>
            <li>Reduce adhesions</li>
            <li>Help the muscles to work at maximum efficiency</li>
            <li>Increase blood circulation</li>
            <li>Increase the flow of lymph</li>
